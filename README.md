# CodeChallenge

This is a simple ruby script that takes a short message as a parameter, encodes it with a private key, and returns a JSON element containing the message, the signature, and the private key. The key pair was generated using OpenSSL.

To run the script use the following command:
ruby main.rb "your message here"
